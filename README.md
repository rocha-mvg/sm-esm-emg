Codes related to the paper "Power Transformers Thermal Modeling using an Enhanced Set-Membership Multivariable Gaussian Evolving Fuzzy System" - under review on Electric Power Systems Research. These codes are also related to the homonymous master's thesis at Federal University of Juiz de Fora, BR.


The package contains 2 compacted files:

1 Transformers
- 1 trafo d2
- 2 trafo d3

2 Benchmarks
- 3 mackey glass
- 4 non linear
- 5 high dimensional

they are organized as follows: each archive has 3 files:
- x_[name of file] - inputs
- y_[name of file] - outputs
- emg_[name of file] - code in python

In python codes, it is worth mentioning that the variable "flag" defines which of the eMG, SM-eMG or ESM-eMG models will be applied.


Please cite this paper if the code helps.
